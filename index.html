<h1>A Man, A Threat, and A Millon Books</h1>

<p id="one">	Senn Hassan’s greatest obstacle in conceiving his most famous story, <i>The Leningrad Affair</i> , known as “The Leningrad Labyrinth” in some circles, revealed itself when he was coming up with a name for the protagonist. Like any master of craft would, Hassan intended to imbue the name of the character with symbolic value, while keeping the metaphor obscure enough so to not disclose the meaning to a reader without the reader having done at least some legwork. It was, according to all accounts — I have not read it — a sordid book, both in regard to its writing style and its subject matter. American critics called the book, “a pro-Communist ruse” and Soviet critics said it was “an inaccurate depiction of the Leningrad elite” and that, “he was misrepresenting their social connectedness.” </p>
<p id="two">	Hassan had never actually been to Leningrad, nor did he know anyone from Leningrad, which made it nearly impossible to write a factual story. But, as any Leningradian would remark, it actually is impossible to write a factual story about the Leningrad elite even for someone who intermingles with the coterie. It mutates too often. If one were to say that Anna Radinikov and Maria Lampov were cordially acquainted, then it might have been true at any point in the past and might be true at any point in the future, but neither of those temporal settings bears any correlation to the present setting of The Leningrad Affair. Which begs the more important question, is something true if only true for an instant? I suspect that is what Hassan intended. I know that, in the end, the publishing of The Leningrad Affair was a weight off his back. He was struggling with ideas bigger than himself at that time and once he published the book he went off the grid. No soul has seen him since.</p>
<p id="three">	His disappearance in ’94 was under such curios circumstances that some figure that it wasn’t a disappearance at all, and was rather a refashioning of his entire life. He’s probably living elsewhere under the name Satoshi Nakamoto, they say, no one had any reason to kidnap, maim, and kill him, they say, and he certainly had no reason to end his own life.</p>
<p id="four">	But I am sure he is dead. </p>
<p id="five">	I know because he once showed me a letter from a crazed admirer that said something vaguely resembling “your protagonist’s name must not immediately make sense to a reader for the safety of your own life.” Hassan kept this letter mostly secret, except for consulting me. He was terrified of the stalker, who had included their own interpretation of the origins of the character names for War & Fleas and Because of G.O.D, two of Hassan’s more obscure works. He felt that fate was slowly conspiring against him, turning his life into one of his own complex stories, where the name of a protagonist was the difference between life and death. Of the things that accounted for Hassan’s anguish in the year leading up to his disappearance – the year in which The Leningrad Affair was published -- the two most jarring were a) that the reader would discern the origins of his protagonist’s name (which would, for all intents and purposes, result in the termination of his existence) and b) the growing fear, because of the similarity between his own quandary and the convoluted plots of his books, that he was actually the main character in someone else’s book, in a layer above Hassan’s own consciousness. “I’m a puppet,” he told me once, “I’m a gosh darn puppet.”</p>
<p id="six">	He wrote to me in a letter just before he started writing The Leningrad Affair: </p>
<p id="seven"><i>	I’ve put in some thought and have concluded that the only way to escape my appalling destiny is to evade the admirer, the reader of my texts. It is clear that the reader has an unparalleled perspicacity and a determination to comprehend the most deep-seated of my symbols. I will not trick the reader, for the reader knows me better than I know myself as evidenced by the countless letters they have sent in which they analyzed the regrettable decisions of my youth and early adulthood and in which they questioned my devotion to my own mother. No single stone of my past would be left unturned and no single obscure story or myth will be left unconsidered. I am not fighting a he or she; I am fighting an ‘it’; an unstoppable force, a computer, or God himself.
	Therefore, I can only think of two ways to get out of the hopeless situation: the first is to kill myself, a cowardly move in the face of a powerful force. The second is to trap the reader in its own research, to lose the reader in a maze of sheer complexity from which it cannot escape, intertwining names and backstories and leads to the point where the reader becomes lost and confused and trapped in my labyrinth. This is my only hope. Let me know what you think of the plan.</i></p>
	

<p id="eight"><i>Senn</i></p>
<p id="nine">I did not write back immediately, for he did not really care for my own approval, but I tracked his progress intimately throughout the months between the last letter I received and his disappearance. He published <i>An Analysis of ‘Karpines’s Mirrors’, Tchemenon’s Last Myth</i> through an auxiliary publishing company based in Jakarta, Indonesia that is tenuously associated with his own publishing company, and of which I am only aware of because he mentioned it to me in passing. He published a book titled <i>The Discreet Librarian Guixong</i>, written in Mandarin. He published seven more pieces, each published with invented dates: an anthology of Tchemenon’s myths; <i>a History of the Library as a Philosophical Arena in Eastern Literature</i>; a biography of Tang, the reclusive author of <i>The Discreet Librarian</i>, in which only a brief mention of <i>The Discreet Librarian</i> is made; a book about the most famous novelists of the Qing Dynasty, where only a quarter page is dedicated to Tang; a non-fiction book called <i>The Secret Connection Between the Nazis and Tchemenon</i>; a pioneering effort on puzzle theory in which Hassan argues that the only way to get to the bottom a mystery is to try every possibility, otherwise known as the “brute force method”; and finally, an English translation of <i>The Discreet Librarian Guixong</i>. He also conducted a fake interview where he told the interviewer -- whom I am certain was also Hassan himself because he used the word “flummox” -- that he was vacillating between two names for the protagonist of his next book, <i>The Leningrad Affair</i>. Those two names, he said, were Karpinov and Guinov, and I had a feeling I knew their origins. </p>
