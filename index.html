<h1>A Man, A Threat, and A Millon Books</h1>

<p id="one">	Senn Hassan’s greatest obstacle in conceiving his most famous story, <i>The Leningrad Affair</i> , known as “The Leningrad Labyrinth” in some circles, revealed itself when he was coming up with a name for the protagonist. Like any master of craft would, Hassan intended to imbue the name of the character with symbolic value, while keeping the metaphor obscure enough so to not disclose the meaning to a reader without the reader having done at least some legwork. It was, according to all accounts — I have not read it — a sordid book, both in regard to its writing style and its subject matter. American critics called the book, “a pro-Communist ruse” and Soviet critics said it was “an inaccurate depiction of the Leningrad elite” and that, “he was misrepresenting their social connectedness.” </p>
<p id="two">	Hassan had never actually been to Leningrad, nor did he know anyone from Leningrad, which made it nearly impossible to write a factual story. But, as any Leningradian would remark, it actually is impossible to write a factual story about the Leningrad elite even for someone who intermingles with the coterie. It mutates too often. If one were to say that Anna Radinikov and Maria Lampov were cordially acquainted, then it might have been true at any point in the past and might be true at any point in the future, but neither of those temporal settings bears any correlation to the present setting of <i>The Leningrad Affair</i>. Which begs the more important question, is something true if only true for an instant? I suspect that is what Hassan intended. I know that, in the end, the publishing of <i>The Leningrad Affair</i> was a weight off his back. He was struggling with ideas bigger than himself at that time and once he published the book he went off the grid. No soul has seen him since, or no soul that I have talked to at least.</p>
<p id="three">	His disappearance in ’94 was under such curious circumstances that some figure it wasn’t a disappearance at all, and was rather a refashioning of his entire life. He’s probably living elsewhere under the name Satoshi Nakamoto, they say, no one had any reason to kidnap, maim, and kill him, they say, and he certainly had no reason to end his own life.</p>
<p id="four">	But I am sure he is dead. </p>
<p id="five">	I know because he once showed me a letter from a crazed admirer that said something vaguely resembling “your protagonist’s name must not immediately make sense to a reader for the safety of your own life.” Hassan kept this letter mostly secret, except for consulting me. He was terrified of the stalker, who had included their own interpretation of the origins of the character names for <i>War & Fleas</i> and <i>Because of G.O.D</i>, two of Hassan’s more obscure works. He felt that fate was slowly conspiring against him, turning his life into one of his own complex stories, where the name of a protagonist was the difference between life and death. Of the things that accounted for Hassan’s anguish in the year leading up to his disappearance – the year in which The Leningrad Affair was published -- the two most jarring were a) that the reader would discern the origins of his protagonist’s name (which would, for all intents and purposes, result in the termination of his existence) and b) the growing fear, because of the similarity between his own quandary and the convoluted plots of his books, that he was actually the main character in someone else’s book, in a layer above Hassan’s own consciousness. “I’m a puppet,” he told me once, “I’m a gosh darn puppet.”</p>
<p id="six">	He wrote to me in a letter just before he started writing The Leningrad Affair: </p>
<p id="seven"><i>	I’ve put in some thought and have concluded that the only way to escape my appalling destiny is to evade the admirer, the reader of my texts. It is clear that the reader has an unparalleled perspicacity and a determination to comprehend the most deep-seated of my symbols. I will not trick the reader, for the reader knows me better than I know myself as evidenced by the countless letters they have sent in which they analyzed the regrettable decisions of my youth and early adulthood and in which they questioned my devotion to my own mother. No single stone of my past would be left unturned and no single obscure story or myth will be left unconsidered. I am not fighting a he or she; I am fighting an ‘it’; an unstoppable force, a computer, or God himself.
	Therefore, I can only think of two ways to get out of the hopeless situation: the first is to kill myself, a cowardly move in the face of a powerful force. The second is to trap the reader in its own research, to lose the reader in a maze of sheer complexity from which it cannot escape, intertwining names and backstories and leads to the point where the reader becomes lost and confused and trapped in my labyrinth. This is my only hope. Let me know what you think of the plan.</i></p>
<p id="eight"><i>Senn</i></p>
<p id="nine">I did not write back immediately, for he did not really care for my own approval, but I tracked his progress intimately throughout the months between the last letter I received and his disappearance. He published <i>An Analysis of ‘Karpines’s Mirrors’, Tchemenon’s Last Myth</i> through an auxiliary publishing company based in Jakarta, Indonesia that is tenuously associated with his own publishing company, and of which I am only aware of because he mentioned it to me in passing. He published a book titled <i>The Discreet Librarian Guixong</i>, written in Mandarin. He published seven more pieces, each published with invented dates: an anthology of Tchemenon’s myths; <i>a History of the Library as a Philosophical Arena in Eastern Literature</i>; a biography of Tang, the reclusive author of <i>The Discreet Librarian</i>, in which only a brief mention of <i>The Discreet Librarian</i> is made; a book about the most famous novelists of the Qing Dynasty, where only a quarter page is dedicated to Tang; a non-fiction book called <i>The Secret Connection Between the Nazis and Tchemenon</i>; a pioneering effort on puzzle theory in which Hassan argues that the only way to get to the bottom a mystery is to try every possibility, otherwise known as the “brute force method”; and finally, an English translation of <i>The Discreet Librarian Guixong</i>. He also conducted a fake interview where he told the interviewer -- whom I am certain was also Hassan himself because he used the word “flummox” -- that he was vacillating between two names for the protagonist of his next book, <i>The Leningrad Affair</i>. Those two names, he said, were Karpinov and Guinov, and I had a feeling I knew their origins. </p>


<p id="gpre">
From <i>The Discreet Librarian Guixong</i>:
</p>
<p id="gone"><i>
This wouldn’t be an interesting story, but for two tidbits: Guixong’s assertion that he and the mythological hero Atlas are one and the same, and an earthquake that reached 8.8 on the Richter scale.	
</i></p>
<p id="gtwo"><i>
The library in the heart of Qinxi, held the most comprehensive collection of books in the world, measured decisively by the total number of words printed on each page of each book of each shelf of each room. Manuscripts had been donated to the library from all corners of the globe due to the library’s owners parading across the earth, advertising the limitless storage capacity of the Qinxi Public Library. Consequently, Qinxi Public was sent tattered pamphlets, whose owners were not yet willing to completely let them go.	
</i></p>
<p id="gthree"><i>
The man tasked with organizing the excess books, by his own delegation, although he would tell you it was the delegation of the universe’s forces, was Guixong. Every new book that arrived to the Qinxi Public Library, Guixong had to tag it with its Dewey Decimal number and order it on the shelves, which were long and tall, organized in parallel rows that stretch miles back into the depths of the library. Of course, there were too many books to organize them alphabetically. They were first arranged by time period – some books even dated back as far as 500 BC – and then by genre then by author and after that by the alphabetized system so common to Western shelves. By the time he finished placing new books on the shelf, a new shipment would arrive for Guixong to decipher each new book’s history and context, meaning and purpose, and deposit it in the necessary location. As a result of this, Guixong is endowed with the ceaseless obligation of ordering the books, a task which he both loves and hates and refers to as Atlasian — for its restrictive schedule (full-time as in no breaks), but its heroic premise. Guixong ticked along the aisles of the ever-expanding library because he was the gear that made the clock work. 	
</i></p>
<p id="gfour"><i>
The earthquake — that the locals call “the worst one” — ripped through the center of Qinxi quickly, lasting for only a few seconds, but leaving immense damage as the walls and roof of the library collapsed inwards, toppling onto ages of information, opinions, and love letters. Witnesses say that Guixong, perplexed and anxious, summited the largest rubble pile and began picking off cracked bricks until a few sad books were uncovered. In his hands, dirty with the dust of fallen stone, he ordered the few books he had left in the right order: time period then genre then author then alphabetized by title. Townspeople had to yell to Guixong atop the rubble pile, “forget it Guixong, it’s no use now. The books are destroyed.” No one had seen Guixong in years as he’d been carrying out his endless obligation or reordering books and didn’t have a spare minute to socialize. 	
</i></p>
<p id="gfive"><i>
In the days that followed, only one hundred books were recovered. Guixong penned letters to the owners of the books explaining that most of the documents had been lost, that the ignored manuscripts in the Qinxi library could never be retrieved. Except for the books that Guixong kept for himself. He was now unemployed and homeless, with his former living quarter, complete with a straw mattress, was buried with hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, of books under the collapsed library. Guixong managed to salvage a wheeling bookrack from the rubble, its second shelf too cracked to support any weight. Only the top and bottom racks could hold his remaining books, but how should he order them now that he no longer answered to the calls of owners from all different corners of the globe? Some townspeople spoke to him of the allure of sorting by preference. The necessary precondition to that, of course, was to read every book in his possession, which he’d never had time to do. So, Guixong, in his newfound spare time decided to read every book that he had in his possession. The first book he chose to read was:
</i></p>

<p id="kone">From An Analysis of <i>‘Karpines’ Mirrors’, Tchemenon’s Last Myth:</i></p>
<p id="ktwo"><i>There are more reasons to be skeptical of the authenticity of Tchemenon’s last myth than just the faux-Greek name Karpines. Everywhere throughout Karpines’ Mirrors there are anachronisms casting doubt in the minds of classics scholars. Critics have suggested that Tchemenon did not write the myth and, like Homer, it was actually a committee, but not a committee of Tchemenon’s contemporaries, rather a committee of modern writers trying to forge their way into history.</i></p>
<p id="kthree"><i>Nowhere in other ancient Greek literature can one find a mention of Karpines’ Mirrors. Mentions of his other works appear frequently in Herodotus’s writings, giving them historical legitimacy. However, the same level of historical legitimacy cannot be claimed about Karpines’ Mirrors, as no scholar has ever come across a mention of it in legitimized literature. That suggests two possibilities, that Karpines’ Mirrors was disliked by the Greeks, who loved the rest of Tchemenon’s myths, or that the Greeks were unaware of it, giving promise to the theory that the myth was created hundreds of years later.</i></p>
<p id="kfour"><i>That is purely speculation, though, and offers no conclusive evidence that Karpines’ Mirrors are a farce. But Karpines’ Mirrors plot is incongruous with the styles and themes of Tchmenon’s other plots. The concept of the mirrored maze that serves as a vehicle for Karpines’ self-discovery is too emotionally nuanced to have been the work of Tchemenon, a man whose myths are normally full of emotionless action.</i></p>
<p id="kfive"><i>In addition, Greek myth usually feature Gods or Goddesses as the protagonist, but Karpines’ Mirrors features Karpines, who is a mortal. A God is only present when Karpines imagines Daedalus somewhere in the infinity extending between two parallel mirrors. When he speaks to Daedalus, the maker of the mirrored labyrinth, Karpines asks which way to proceed, as Karpines himself is highly disoriented. Daedalus disappears and it is then that Karpines understands that the way out of the labyrinth is not to ask for assistance, but rather skirt along the walls and cut the bottom of his foot to leave a trail. If Tchemenon wrote this myth, Daedalus would’ve helped Karpines exit the labyrinth. As it is, the solution is too humanist for Tchemenon to have written it. He was a firm believer in the hopelessness of man’s condition, as noted in Themenoclys’s biography of Tchemenon. As Themenoclys writes, “In a room with Tchemenon, you never get the feeling he trusts himself or anyone else. Yet his misanthropy is simply another sign of his piety. He prays to the Gods ten times a day and hopes that his prayers will make the Gods shine their favor upon him” [translation]. If Tchemenon was a misanthrope, would his last myth feature a man finding his own way without the help of a God? Maybe he had a change of heart, but it seems unlikely.</i></p>
<p id="ksix"><i>The absolutely damning evidence that Karpines’ Mirrors was not written by Tchemenon comes in the form of diction, specifically the Greek word “ethelos.” This word, found just two paragraphs from the end of the myth, is the proverbial “nail in the coffin” on the Karpines’ Mirrors debate. “Ethelos,” translating roughly into irrigation system, was not actually a word in the Greek lexicon until long after Tchemenon lived, meaning he couldn’t have possibly used this word in his myth. The story goes that the Greek word “ethelos” was put into Greek vocabulary after the Roman implementation of Aqueducts, which Greeks in the Roman period had no word for. Therefore, “ethelos” would still show up in a dictionary of ancient Greek words, but it would have never been used by Tchemenon who predated the word by about 400 years. This means that, at the earliest, this myth could’ve been written around 300 BC. However, it could be reasonably argued that Karpines’ Mirrors was written after the publication of the bestselling “Ancient Greek Dictionary for Modern Writers” because the dictionary’s imperfect translation of “ethelos” to mean “unexpected river or stream” is exactly how “ethelos” is used in Karpines’ Mirrors. The translation of Karpines’ Mirrors gives the contested line as:</i></p>
<p id="kseven">"An unexpected stream drifted down from Karpines’ eyes, touched his cheek, and dripped off his chin, floating to the floor."</p>
<p id="keight"><i>Whereas a correct translation of “ethelos” would warrant the result:</i></p>
<p id="knine">"An irrigation system drifted down from Karpines’ eyes, touched his cheek, and dripped off his chin, floating to the floor."</p>
<p id="kten"><i>If the theory is correct, this small inconsistency in the etymology of ethelos dates the word to the 20th Century. Deciphering exactly who penned Karpines’ Mirrors would be undoubtedly difficult, but a name appears that gives historians pause. It might hold a clue about who wrote Karpines’ Mirrors. Guixong. Nobody has been able to figure out what it refers to.</i></p>

<p id="wone">From <i>The Work of High School Student Will Nuelle:</i></p>
<p id="wtwo"><i>Will Nuelle has had no significant or noteworthy output. He attempted to write a labyrinthine story in the way of Jorge Luis Borges as a senior in high school and put it on the computer.</i></p>
<p id="wthree">Guixong paused at the mention of a computer. “What on earth is a computer?” He asked one of the townspeople, a short man who said he knew of an Internet café nearby.</p>
<p id="wfour">A cashier asked Guixong, “Would you like to rent a computer?” Guixong shrugged.</p>
<p id="wfive">Guixong sat down at a computer. Baffled, he asked the cashier, “What do I do?”</p>
<p id="wsix">“Well, what are you looking for?”</p>
<p id="wseven">“Will Nuelle.”</p>
<p id="weight">The cashier typed Will Nuelle onto the screen in front of him and clicked on the first link. This story popped onto the screen. Shit.</p>

<p id="tone">An Excerpt From <i>Wild Wild West:</i></p>
<p id="ttwo"><i>Cowboy Jim took out his handgun and pointed at the saloon owner. </i></p>
<p id="tthree"><i>Are we ‘unna to ‘av ourselves a standoff?” he asked.</i></p>
<p id="tfour"><i>“If you say so, Jim, if you say so. This is your own doin’, Jim.” The saloon owner pulled out a handgun and pointed it at Cowboy Jim.</i></p>
<p id="tfive">By now Guixong was sure that he would thoroughly dislike the rest of the book, so he placed it at the way back of the rack. He had officially ordered his first book. He had to choose which one to read next:</p>
