<h1>A Man, A Threat, and A Millon Books</h1>

<p id="demo">Senn Hassan’s greatest obstacle in conceiving his most famous story, The Leningrad Affair, known as “The Leningrad Labyrinth” in some circles, revealed itself when he was coming up with a name for the protagonist. Like any master of craft would, Hassan intended to imbue the name of the character with symbolic value, while keeping the metaphor obscure enough so to not disclose the meaning to a reader without the reader having done at least some legwork. It was, according to all accounts — I have not read it — a sordid book, both in regard to its writing style and its subject matter. American critics called the book, “a pro-Communist ruse” and Soviet critics said it was “an inaccurate depiction of the Leningrad elite” and that, “he was misrepresenting their social connectedness.” </p>
<p id="demo">Hassan had never actually been to Leningrad, nor did he know anyone from Leningrad, which made it nearly impossible to write a factual story. But, as any Leningradian would remark, it actually is impossible to write a factual story about the Leningrad elite even for someone who intermingles with the coterie. It mutates too often. If one were to say that Anna Radinikov and Maria Lampov were cordially acquainted, then it might have been true at any point in the past and might be true at any point in the future, but neither of those temporal settings bears any correlation to the present setting of The Leningrad Affair. Which begs the more important question, is something true if only true for an instant? I suspect that is what Hassan intended. I know that, in the end, the publishing of The Leningrad Affair was a weight off his back. He was struggling with ideas bigger than himself at that time and once he published the book he went off the grid. No soul has seen him since.</p>
