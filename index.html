<p id="demo">Senn Hassan’s greatest obstacle in conceiving his most famous story, The Leningrad Affair, known as “The Leningrad Labyrinth” in some circles, revealed itself when he was coming up with a name for the protagonist. Like any master of craft would, Hassan intended to imbue the name of the character with symbolic value, while keeping the metaphor obscure enough so to not disclose the meaning to a reader without the reader having done at least some legwork. It was, according to all accounts — I have not read it — a sordid book, both in regard to its writing style and its subject matter. American critics called the book, “a pro-Communist ruse” and Soviet critics said it was “an inaccurate depiction of the Leningrad elite” and that, “he was misrepresenting their social connectedness.” </p>
